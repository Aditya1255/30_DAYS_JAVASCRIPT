//NUMBERS
//numbers can be either integer or floating point numbers.

//string
//string data type is used when we want to store text, character or a word;

console.log(myName);

//Boolean

let value = true;
console.log(value);

//undefine and null

let Balance = null; //NUll means empty or nothing or 0.

console.log(typeof(myAge) + " " + typeof(myName) + " " + typeof(value) + " " + typeof(car) + " " + typeof(Balance)); //here we have used concatinating.
